      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        This website was created to share fun, friendly, and easy-to-understand 
        information about the amphibians that live in Wisconsin. Frogs, toads, 
        and salamanders are often overlooked, yet they play a vital role in our 
        ecosystems. Here, you can explore facts, learn about different species, 
        and discover how unique these animals really are.

      <h2>Why Amphibians?</h2>
      <p>
        Amphibians are some of the most fascinating creatures on Earth. They 
        breathe through their skin, survive harsh winters, and adapt to 
        environments ranging from forests to ponds. By highlighting their stories, 
        this website aims to spark curiosity and encourage people to appreciate 
        the wildlife around them.
