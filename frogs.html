  <h2>Frogs</h2>
  <p>
    Frogs are the most well-known amphibians in the world. When most people think 
    of amphibians, their minds go straight to the tiny frogs hopping around a pond. 
    But frogs are much more than the little green creatures you see in your backyard. 
    They live all over the globe and have some of the most impressive adaptations in 
    the animal kingdom.
  </p>

  <p>
    Frogs are especially famous for their unique life cycle. Everything begins with 
    their eggs, which have no shells at all. Once they hatch, the young become 
    tadpoles that feed on aquatic plants, insects, small fish, and almost anything 
    they can fit into their tiny mouths. As they grow, tadpoles transform into 
    froglets, and eventually into fully developed adult frogs.

  <h3>Frogs of Wisconsin</h3>

  <h4>Gray Tree Frog</h4>
  <p>
    Most native frogs in Wisconsin prefer ponds and wetlands, but there are a few 
    exceptions. One of the most fascinating is the gray tree frog. This species is 
    one of the only arboreal frogs in Wisconsin, spending much of its time in the 
    trees. Gray tree frogs can appear in many colors, including dark gray, brown, 
    and even dusty green to blend in with tree bark.
  </p>

  <h4>Green Frog</h4>
  <p>
    Green frogs are the most common frog species in Wisconsin. They live in ponds, 
    lakes, streams, and shallow rivers. Their diet includes flies, moths, 
    dragonflies, mosquitoes, and other small insects. Green frogs typically stay 
    near the water their entire lives and hibernate during the winter.
  </p>

  <h4>Wood Frog</h4>
  <p>
    Wood frogs live on the forest floor, blending into the leaf litter with their 
    small brown bodies. Even though they do not seem like tree climbers, they have 
    sticky toes that allow them to climb vertical surfaces to find food or escape 
    predators.
