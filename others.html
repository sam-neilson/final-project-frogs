  <h3>lil' freaks of the world</h3>

  <h4>Sirens</h4>
  <p>
    siren, (family Sirenidae), any member of the family Sirenidae, a group of five North American species of aquatic salamanders that resemble eels. Their long slender bodies are usually brown, dark gray, or greenish. The forelegs are tiny, and the hind legs and pelvis are absent. Young and adults have feathery gills. The greater siren (Siren lacertina) is 50–90 cm (20–35 inches) long and occurs in the Atlantic coastal states of the United States from Delaware southward to Florida and westward to northern Mexico
Sirens usually burrow in mud in the bottom of marshes or streams or hide among water plants or stones. However, on rare occasions they may venture onto dry land for brief periods. Out of the water, they can make a soft yelping or squeaking sound. Their principal diet is made up of aquatic insects and other invertebrates, which they catch at night.

  <h4>ceceilains</h4>
  <p>
   Caecilians are a group of limbless, worm-shaped or snake-shaped amphibians, with either small eyes or no eyes, comprising the order Gymnophiona.
    They mostly live hidden in soil or in streambeds, making them some of the least familiar amphibians.
  </p>

  <h4>newts</h4>
  <p>
A newt is a salamander in the subfamily Pleurodelinae. 
The terrestrial juvenile phase is called an eft. Unlike other members of the family Salamandridae, newts are semiaquatic, alternating between aquatic and terrestrial habitats.
 Not all aquatic salamanders are considered newts, however. More than 100 known species of newts are found in North America, Europe, North Africa and Asia. Newts metamorphose through three distinct developmental life stages: aquatic larva, terrestrial juvenile (eft), and adult.
 Adult newts have lizard-like bodies and return to the water every year to breed, otherwise living in humid, cover-rich land habitats.
