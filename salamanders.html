        at first salamanders appear to be a slimy lizard but they are in fact amphibians! the lineage started some time in the Sometime in the Jurassic where they split off from the common ancestor of all other amphibians. 
    They are small, with long tails, four splayed legs, and ridges along their sides. 
    Salamanders are often found on land under logs, rocks, leaf litter, or objects left out in the woods. 
    Salamanders also go through metamorphosis just like the rest of their cousins. They start off with soft, squishy eggs and from there become something called a nymph.
     This stage means they are fully aquatic with their gills sticking out the side of their head. 
     The most famous example of a salamander looking like this is the axolotl. Unlike other species that eventually shed their gills and move onto land, axolotls stay in the water up into their adult life, never getting over that baby phase.
      However, all the species in Wisconsin all go on land in their adult stage.

  <h2>salamanders</h2>
  <p>
Salamanders can range wildly in their sizes, from the tiny pygmy salamander which ranges from 33mm to 50mm, to the japanese giant salamander which can reach over 5ft long and weigh over 50 pounds!
 There are several species endemic to Wisconsin that are vital for the ecosystem.
  They help control the population of worms, beetles, and other insects. Salamanders also act as indicators of ecosystem health.
   As fragile beings they often are the first to fall or vanish when something is wrong with their environment. 
   From pollution, climate change, food scarcity and even soil disruption, all of these impact salamander populations and let scientists know something is wrong with their ecosystem.
    The presence of salamanders indicates a healthy soil and bug population which is vital for forest health.

  <h3>salamanders of Wisconsin</h3>

  <h4>four toed salamanders</h4>
  <p>
 These little guys are native to northeast America and live in Wisconsin. They have a greyish body with spots and a bright white belly along with four toes (such is the name). They feed off small invertebrates such as spring tails, worms, centipedes, and other creepy crawlies. 
This species' favored habitats are sphagnum bogs, grassy areas surrounding beaver ponds, and deciduous or mixed forests rich with mosses. 

  </p>

  <h4>blue spotted salamanders</h4>
  <p>
 These guys have a very interesting look, with bright blue spots, a black body and a white belly they are a fun find for any herping party. Blue-spotted salamanders are primarily found in moist, deciduous hardwood forests and swampy woodlands with sandy soil, though they can be found in coniferous forests and fields too. They prefer vernal pools that retain water into mid-summer, to ensure access to a suitable breeding habitat. Blue-spotted salamanders are philopatric and largely dependent on the availability of ephemeral pools
Blue-spotted salamanders have several defense mechanisms. The blue spots on the salamander's back and tail make it difficult for predators to clearly see the salamander. Blue-spotted salamanders also have specialized glands on their tails that secrete a milky substance which is harmful to predators.

  <h4>yellow spotted salamanders</h4>
  <p>
   Yellow spotted salamanders are a burrowing species that live all over America including Wisconsin. They have a black body, with bright yellow spots that cover them. They are larger than the other natives ranging from 21/2 inches to 6inches in length which helps them hunt larger prey. They also eat bugs from larger worms, to rolipolies, and even large spiders. They burrow down into deep mud and soil under large rocks or roots to hunt. They only come out at night to hunt and rarely move around in the daytime.
