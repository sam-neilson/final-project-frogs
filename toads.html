    toads, while often confused for frogs are not quite the same. toads are adapted for drier lands and can go longer without water. their skin is rough, bumpy, and often grey or brown in color.
   toads are interesting as they are techinally frogs, however not every frog is a toad. toads are good at hopping or crawling around the ground and dont do the long leaps that frogs are capable of. 
   to defend themselves many toads make their own poisons that ooze from glands on their skin. this can range from tasting bad, to burning or irritation to downright deadly like the cane toad.

  <h3>toad of Wisconsin</h3>

  <h4>the american toad</h4>
  <p>
   
The American toad can easily be identified by its dry rough skin and large swellings behind the eyes (paratoid glands). Its dorsal color can vary from brown to reddish to olive, with scattered dark spots, each encircling one to three wart-like bumps on the back. Their thick skin, which traps body fluids better than most amphibians, allows toads to live greater distances from water than most frogs.
Toads live in a wide variety of habitats ranging from prairies to wetlands to forests. They are somewhat adapted to urban settings where they occasionally persist in gardens and parks. The toad's call is a long, uninterrupted trill lasting up to 30 seconds. Each male has a slightly different pitch. They lay eggs in long strands, unique among Wisconsin's amphibians. Toad tadpoles form schools, also unique among Wisconsin frogs.
